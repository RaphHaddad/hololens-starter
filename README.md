# XR Starter

Little starter project for XR development.

Designed for Hololens (MRTK), but should be fine for other platforms too.

Includes

* MRTK (helpful utils for MR development)
* Photon (sharing)
* Vuforia (marker-based tracking)
* Initial tracking marker (so sharing works fine)

## Usage

* Clone this repo
* Open it in Unity (2018.3.0f2 was used to create it)
